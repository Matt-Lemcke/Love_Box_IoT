## Final Product

The number display shows the number of day since a specific date, either an anniversary or the last day you've seen each other. The user can press the push button to send a notification to the other person that has the phone with the Blynk app. The app user can start the LED heart animation with the Send Love button and adjust the sleep time of the device to allow the microcontroller to cool down during hours with little activity.
